# Hi-Link Eagle library

Eagle library containing:

HLK-5M05

HLK-PM01


Thanks to github.com/AhmedAdelHosni I got my first Hi-Link footprint for the HLK-PM01.
I recently needed the 5Watt version (HLK-5M05) for a project but could not find the Eagle file so I decided to draw it.
Perhaps I can help other people out by putting it online.
